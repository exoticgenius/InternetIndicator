# Lightweight Internet Indicator

A lightweight and simple-to-use network connection monitor. It continuously tests ping (speed and other metrics coming soon) in a user-configurable fashion and allows you to view the data in live interactive charts.

The program itself is designed to be run on an always-on computer so that it can constantly be collecting data.

There is no database and no information is collected from the user.
